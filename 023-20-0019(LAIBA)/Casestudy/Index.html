          <h2>AI Should Augment Human Intelligence, Not Replace It</h2>
          <h5>By David De Cremer and Garry Kasparov</h5>
          <p>
            In an economy where data is changing how companies create value —
            and compete — experts predict that using artificial intelligence
            (AI) at a larger scale will add as much as $15.7 trillion to the
            global economy by 2030. As AI is changing how companies work, many
            believe that who does this work will change, too — and that
            organizations will begin to replace human employees with intelligent
            machines. This is already happening: intelligent systems are
            displacing humans in manufacturing, service delivery, recruitment,
            and the financial industry, consequently moving human workers
            towards lower-paid jobs or making them unemployed. This trend has
            led some to conclude that in 2040 our workforce may be totally
            unrecognizable.
          </p>
          <p>
            We believe, however, that this view of the role AI will play in the
            workplace is wrong. The question of whether AI will replace human
            workers assumes that AI and humans have the same qualities and
            abilities — but, in reality, they don’t. AI-based machines are fast,
            more accurate, and consistently rational, but they aren’t intuitive,
            emotional, or culturally sensitive. And, it’s exactly these
            abilities that humans posses and which make us effective.

            <h2 class="py-3">Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
              Augmented intelligence, as the third type of AI, is the step
              forward to the future of intelligent work. The future of work is a
              concept used to indicate the growth of employees and their
              performance in more efficient ways. The debate on this topic,
              however, has become quite ambiguous in its intentions.
              Specifically, because of cost-cutting strategies narratives,
              businesses today are in a stage where machines are often
              introduced as the new super employee that may leave humans
              ultimately in an inferior role to serve machine. An essential
              element of a truly intelligent type of future of work, however,
              means that we do expand the workforce where both humans and
              machine will be part of, but with the aim to improve humanity and
              well-being while also being more efficient in the execution of our
              jobs. So, augmented intelligence is indeed collaborative in
              nature, but it’s also clear that it represents a collaborative
              effort in service of humans.

          <h3>Machine Intelligence vs. Human Intelligence</h3>
          <p>
            In general, people recognize today’s advanced computers as
            intelligent because they have the potential to learn and make
            decisions based on the information they take in. But while we may
            recognize that ability, it’s a decidedly different type of
            intelligence what we posses. These qualities mean that AI is
            perfectly suited to put at work in lower-level routine tasks that
            are repetitive and take place within a closed management system. In
            such a system, the rules of the game are clear and not influenced by
            external forces. Think, for example, of an assembly line where
            workers are not interrupted by external demands and influences like
            work meetings. As a case in point, the assembly line is exactly the
            place where Amazon placed algorithms in the role of managers to
            supervise human workers and even fire them. As the work is
            repetitive and subject to rigid procedures optimizing efficiency and
            productivity, AI is able to perform in more accurate ways to human
            supervisors.
          </p>
          <p>
            In its simplest form, AI is a computer acting and deciding in ways
            that seem intelligent. In line with Alan Turing’s philosophy, AI
            imitates how humans act, feel, speak, and decide. This type of
            intelligence is extremely useful in an organizational setting:
            Because of its imitating abilities, AI has the quality to identify
            informational patterns that optimize trends relevant to the job. In
            addition, contrary to humans, AI never gets physically tired and as
            long it’s fed data it will keep going.
          </p>
          <p>
            Human abilities, however, are more expansive. Contrary to AI
            abilities that are only responsive to the data available, humans
            have the ability to imagine, anticipate, feel, and judge changing
            situations, which allows them to shift from short-term to long-term
            concerns. These abilities are unique to humans and do not require a
            steady flow of externally provided data to work as is the case with
            artificial intelligence. In this way humans represent what we call
            authentic intelligence — a different type of AI, if you will. This
            type of intelligence is needed when open systems are in place. In an
            open management system, the team or organization is interacting with
            the external environment and therefore has to deal with influences
            from outside. Such work setting requires the ability to anticipate
            and work with, for example, sudden changes and distorted information
            exchange, while at the same time being creative in distilling a
            vision and future strategy. In open systems, transformation efforts
            are continuously at work and effective management of that process
            requires authentic intelligence.
